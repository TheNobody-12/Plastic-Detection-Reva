# Plastic Detection Solution - Project README

## Overview
This project aims to improve object detection for plastic items using the YOLOv8 algorithm. The solution includes a user-friendly interface developed with Flask and a MySQL database for efficient data management. The evaluation of detection performance is based on the MAP50 metric. Additionally, data visualization tools such as line charts, bar graphs, and pie charts display the density of plastics in each image.

## Solution Components
- **Algorithms Used:** YOLOv8
- **Evaluation Parameters:** MAP50
- **Frontend:** Flask
- **Database:** MySQL

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to Phase 2 and follow the instructions in the `README.md` file to set up the Flask prototype.

## Usage
1. Run the Flask app to access the user-friendly interface.
2. Upload captured images to get plastic item detection results.
3. View latitude, longitude, and geolocation information alongside detection results.
4. Explore line charts, bar graphs, and pie charts to visualize plastic density in each image.
5. Utilize the MySQL database for data analysis and decision-making.
